            I am Jasmine N. Abucejo, youngest of the five siblings. Born and
            raised in Cavite, I graduated class valedictorian on my elementary
            years. I have a degree in Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at
            Cavite State University.

            I had an experience in frontend development from my internship at
            Pixels8 Web Solutions and Consultancy Inc. using Vue.js and CSS for
            designing. I also gained bit of QA experience as I was assigned to
            test other team's project based on the standard set by the company.

            I am currently expanding my knowledge in fronted web development by
            learning React.js and other related technologies through creating
            personal projects. In the future, I am planning to learn more about
            programming languages and frameworks to become a full-stack
            developer.
